***Notation***

Types of chords:
(roman numeral notation)

- Major 7:
Imaj7

- Minor 7:
imin7

- Dominant 7:
I7

- Half-Diminished:
iHdim7

- Fully Diminished 7:
idim7

**Triads**

- Major: I
- Minor: i
- Diminished: idim
- Augmented: Iaug

**Alterations**
(append to end of chord name)

- Sharp 5/Flat 5: s5/b5
- Sharp 11: s11
- Sharp 9/Flat 9: s9/b9
- 6/9 chord: Triad + 69
- Fully Altered Dominant (altered 5, altered 9): alt
- Major/Minor7: Min Triad + minmaj7 (ex. iminmaj7)

***Chord Matrices***

- Will contain all chord tones of scale from root to 7th

***Voicing Matrices***

- Contain indices of voices (ex. a voicing that goes from bottom, root, 7, 3, 5, would look like [0, 3, 1, 2])


**Theory things**

Scales & modes:

- Modes of Major (Ionian) Scale: **Imaj7, iimin7, iiimin7, IVmaj7, V7, vimin7, viiHdim7**

- Minor 7 chords contain a minor 3rd and a minor 7th (with respect to the root of the chord)

- Major 7 chords contain a major 3rd and a major 7th

- Min/Maj 7 chords contain a minor 3rd and a MAJOR 7th

- Dominant chords contain a major 3rd and a MINOR 7th

- Major 6/9 chords can omit a 7th, and add in the 6 and 9 from the corresponding major scale.

- Minor 6/9 chords can omit a 7th, and add in the 6 and 9 ALSO FROM THE CORRESPONDING MAJOR SCALE. (ex. Cmin6/9 contains C, Eb, G, A, D. Note how the A is natural, pulled from the C major scale.)


- Dorian Scale (for minor chords): take major scale, b3, b7 (or think of as second mode of major scale), ex, for Dmin7 chord, use notes **D E F G A B C** (NO Bb!!! No flat 6 playing notes over a minor chord [natural minor])

- Diminished Scales: For our sake, it will be easier to think in half/whole scales. So for a chord like C7b9 or CHdim7 (ironically, not Cdim7), you can use notes **C, Db, Eb, E, F#, G, Ab, Bb** (alternating half and whole steps).

- The other type of diminished scale (whole/half) can only be used on Fully Diminished chords, like Cdim7. So over C dim 7, you would use **C, D, Eb, F, F#, G#, A, B**

- Over a fully altered dominant chord (ex. C7b9b5, C7b9#5, C7alt, etc) you CANNOT use the Diminished scale, as the half/whole contains a NATURAL 5 and the whole/half contains a NATURAL 9. So, we must introduce the Altered Scale. Theorywise, an altered scale is just a scale that contains all possible alterations, aka b9, #9, b5/#11, #5/b13, and dominant 7. So starting on C, the scale would be **C Db D# E F# G# Bb**. Notice, since it is designed for altered dominant chords, it contains the regular major 3rd that a dominant chord has.
